E' semplicemente geniale aver ideato questo modo di comporre le lettere dell'afabeto.
   Anche a livello simbolico questa forma di comunicazione √® in totale sintonia rispetto al suo contenuto, perch√® evidenzia l'importanza di essere parte integrante di una moltitudine che si muove all'unisono.
Bravissimi !!!

Hello everyone, I have a question. I'd like to use the Whisper API to transcribe approximately 2 hours of a conference speech from an mp4 video into an srt subtitle file. I have a few questions:
Do I need to convert the mp4 file into wav or mp3 format first?
It seems that the Whisper API has a file size limit of 25MB per processing. If I split the video into chunks, the resulting srt file might have incorrect timecodes. How should I handle this? Thank you.

Try Microsoft Clipchamp. Gives acces to free stock Fotos and videos. Supports Text to Video. And Text to speach. I have acces to a preview. And do not know, wheather this version is meanwhile delivered through the Windows Store.

We're about to launch an AI related blog. We will use Gleam service for contests to build up the momentum on social media. 
   We decided to give away premium versions of AI tools/services like ChatGPT Plus, Midjourney, or the equivalent in cash.
Can you help us brainstorm other reward ideas? What would get you excited?   What would you like to receive as a reward for sharing a few blog posts on social media, subscribing to a newsletter or a YouTube channel?
Please keep in mind our budget is limited, we don't afford to give away Lambos and Ferraris üòÅ
Thank you in advance for any ideas you might have!! Cheers! üí•

is anyone here actually using Chatgpt to make money or recommend a good custom bot builder with knowledgebase? I created my landing pages with Wordpress and looking to integrate AI in it, currently browsing BotB9 and BotPress, but unsure. Looking to see if anyone has experience implementing similar

What are you ultimately looking for? Or what will give you confidence that you have the correct one?
